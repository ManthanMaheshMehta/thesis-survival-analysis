# Survival Prediction in AIDS Patients

**Master’s Thesis: Comparing Traditional and Machine Learning-Based Survival Models**

This project compares traditional survival analysis (Cox Proportional Hazards) with machine learning models (Random Survival Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine) to predict survival outcomes among AIDS patients using data from ACTG Study 175.

🧪 Built an interactive risk prediction dashboard using R Shiny  
📊 Evaluated models using Concordance Index (C-index)  
🛠️ Analysis performed using **R (v4.3.1)** and **SAS (v9.4)**  
💡 Highlighted clinical usability alongside predictive performance
